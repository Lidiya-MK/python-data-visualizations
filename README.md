# Python Data Visualizations

## Overview
This project showcases my skills in Python data visualization using Jupyter notebooks. It includes a collection of datasets from different sources, which I processed and visualized using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project is a practical application of the concepts I learned from a course led by Madecraft and Michael Galarnyk on Python Data Visualization.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the project, I applied several essential techniques and practices, including:

- **Filtering & Cleaning Data**: Efficiently handling and processing large datasets imported from `.xlsx` and `.csv` files.
- **Handling NaN Values**: Identifying and managing missing data (NaN entries) to prevent errors during plotting.
- **Visual Representation**: Creating clear and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Matplotlib Styles**: Utilizing both MATLAB-style and Object-oriented syntax in Matplotlib to achieve different styles and control over the plots.
- **Exporting Data**: Exporting plotted visualizations directly from Jupyter notebooks for further use.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and advanced visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics built on top of Matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To organize code, visualizations, and notes in a readable format.

## Sample Visualizations
Here are some of the visualizations included in the project:

- **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations or data intensity.
- **Line Charts**: To analyze trends over time.
- **Histograms**: To display the distribution of data points.
- **Subplots**: To combine multiple visualizations into a single figure for comparative analysis.

## How to Run
To explore this project in your own environment

1. Clone the repository:
